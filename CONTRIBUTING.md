## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Windows 10/11
* Visual Studio 2022 (recommended) with .NET Framework development workload
* SQL Server (2021 recommended) and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

### Local setup

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Student_Management_System.git
cd Student_Management_System
```

2. Open `SMS.sln` in Visual Studio.

3. Import the database (provided `.bacpac`) into SSMS if you want the seed data and schema locally.

   * In SSMS: Right click on **Databases** ‚Üí **Import Data-tier Application** ‚Üí choose the `.bacpac` file provided in the repo (if present) ‚Üí set the database name to `School` (or update connection strings accordingly).

4. Update connection strings in the project `.cs` files to match your local SQL Server instance. (Search for `Data Source=` or the string used in `README.md`.)

5. Build and run the WinForms application from Visual Studio.

## How to Contribute

### Report a bug / Request a feature

* Open an issue and use clear, descriptive titles.
* For bugs include:

  * Steps to reproduce
  * Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
  * Screenshots or error messages / stack traces
  * Your environment (Windows version, Visual Studio, SQL Server version)

### Work on an issue

1. Comment on the issue you plan to work on. This prevents duplicate work.
2. Create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name:

```
git checkout -b feat/student-search
# or
git checkout -b fix/login-connection-string
```

3. Make changes in your branch, run the application and test manually.
4. Keep commits small and focused.

### Create a pull request (PR)

1. Push your branch to your fork:

```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

2. Open a Pull Request against `RabindranathChanda/Student_Management_System:main`.
3. In the PR description include:

   * What you changed and why
   * Any setup steps required to test
   * Screenshots or short GIFs (if UI changes)
4. Use the PR template (example below) or include the same info in your PR body.

**PR template suggestion**

## Branching & Commit Guidelines

**Branch names**

* `feat/<short-description>` for new features
* `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes
* `chore/<short-description>` for non-functional changes

**Commit messages**

* Use present tense and keep it brief.
* Example: `Add student search by admission number` or `Fix SQL connection string error on startup`

---

## Coding Standards

This is a C# WinForms project targeting .NET Framework 4.8.1. Keep code consistent and maintainable:

* Follow standard C# naming conventions (PascalCase for types and methods, camelCase for parameters and local variables).
* Keep methods small and single-purpose.
* Avoid hard-coded connection strings ‚Äî use a single configuration location or clearly commented placeholders.
* When adding SQL, prefer parameterized queries or stored procedures to avoid SQL injection.
* Add comments where logic is non-obvious.

---

## Database & Connection notes

* The project uses **SQL Server**. If you import the provided `.bacpac`, the default database name used by the README is `School`.
* **Important security note:** Do not commit production connection strings, credentials, or backups containing sensitive data. Use environment-specific values and document how to configure them locally.
* If you add migration scripts or a new `.bacpac`, mention it in your PR and update the README.

---

## Testing & Manual QA

* This repo currently does not include automated tests. When you add new features, please:

  * Document manual testing steps in your PR
  * Add unit tests if you introduce business logic that can be tested outside the UI

* Common manual tests:

  * Add a student ‚Üí verify entry in DB
  * Edit a student ‚Üí verify values update correctly
  * Search/filter features ‚Üí verify results

---

## Maintainers & Review Process

* PRs will be reviewed by project maintainers. Expect feedback requesting changes ‚Äî please address review comments by pushing additional commits to the same branch.
* Keep PRs focused: one feature/fix per PR is ideal.

---

## Good First Issues / Hacktoberfest Tips

If you‚Äôre participating in Hacktoberfest 2025, look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` (or ask in Issues for something approachable). Some good starter ideas:

* UI polish for forms (labels, validation messages)
* Add client-side validation before saving to DB
* Improve README with screenshots and setup steps for newbies
* Add a CONTRIBUTING.md (this file!) and a simple issue template

---
